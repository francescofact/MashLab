A simple MatLab song identifier that used cross-correlation for match a mic recorded audio in a library.

Like Shazam, but way simpler.

This project was developed for the Lab of Signal Processing exam @ Univeristy of Verona.

## How to use it
You just need to create a folder called "lib" with all the songs that you want to be able to recognize. If you want to add also a cover image you will need to put the cover art inside the folder "cover" with the same name of the track file name in png format.

After that, you are set! Just open Mathlab, import the script and run the code. :smile:
